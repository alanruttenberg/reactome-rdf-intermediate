The data model consists of classes (frames) that describe the different concepts (e.g., reaction, molecule). These classes are hierarchically arranged into classes and parental superclasses. Thus, the 'PhysicalEntity' superclass has as children classes such as Complex and GenomeEncodedEntity. Superclasses are used to organize the data structure, but not for annotation by curators. Data are captured by creating instances of classes. Classes have attributes (slots) which hold properties of the instances (e.g., the names and numbers of copies of the molecules that make up a complex). 'Defining' slots are used to identify and distinguish instances in the knowledgebase and help to ensure that essentially identical information is not represented in Reactome in multiple copies.

(annotation-assertion !rdfs:comment   !<http://purl.obolibary.org/obo/reactome/record.owl> "Life on the cellular level is a network of molecular interactions. Molecules are synthesized and degraded, undergo a bewildering array of temporary and permanent modifications, are transported from one location to another, and form complexes with other molecules. Reactome represents all of this complexity as reactions in which input physical entities are converted to output entities. These reactions can occur spontaneously or be facilitated by physical entities acting as catalysts, and their progress can be modulated by regulatory effects of other physical entities. Reactions are linked together by shared physical entities: a product from one reaction may be a substrate in another reaction and may catalyze yet a third. It is often convenient, if sometimes arbitrary, to group such sets of interlinked reactions into pathways.

The functions of macromolecular entities such as proteins are often determined not only by their primary sequences, but by chemical modifications they have undergone. In Reactome, unmodified and modified forms of a protein are distinct physical entities and the modification process is treated as an explicit reaction. A macromolecule's function may depend on whether the molecule is free or complexed with specific other molecules. Reactome treats complexes as physical entities distinct from their components, and the multimerization events that build up complexes are modeled explicitly as reactions.

Cellular compartments play a key role in biological processes. The segregation of molecules into different compartments often regulates the reactions in which those entities can participate, or can be responsible for driving a reaction forward. In Reactome, a molecule in one compartment is distinct from that molecule in another compartment. Thus, extracellular and cytosolic glucose are different Reactome entities and, e.g., the movement of glucose across the plasma membrane is a reaction that converts the extracellular glucose entity into the cytosolic one.

Many biochemical entities and processes appear redundant: there are two or more chemically distinct entities that can act more or less interchangeably. It is often useful to treat functionally equivalent protein isoforms, splice variants, and paralogues as a single entity, implying that any individual entity from the given set could fulfill the same role in a given situation. The Reactome data model allows this type of generalization, but does so explicitly in a way that allows us to trace specific functions back to the individual molecules covered by the generalization.

The goal of the Reactome knowledgebase is to represent human biological processes, but many of these processes have not been directly studied in humans. Rather, a human event has been inferred from experiments on material from a model organism. In such cases, the model organism reaction is annotated in Reactome, the inferred human reaction is annotated as a separate event, and the inferential link between the two reactions is explicitly noted.

Reactome is authored using a frame-based knowledge representation. The data model consists of classes (frames) that describe the different concepts (e.g., reaction, simple entity). Knowledge is captured as instances of these classes (e.g., 'glucose transport across the plasma membrane', 'cytosolic ATP'). Classes have attributes (slots) which hold properties of the instances (e.g., the identities of the molecules that participate as inputs and outputs in a reaction).

Key data classes

PhysicalEntity - PhysicalEntities include individual molecules, multi-molecular complexes, and sets of molecules or complexes grouped together on the basis of shared characteristics. Molecules are further classified as genome encoded (DNA, RNA, and proteins) or not (all others). Attributes of a PhysicalEntity instance capture the chemical structure of an entity, including any covalent modifications in the case of a macromolecule, and its subcellular localization.

PhysicalEntity instances that represent, e.g., the same chemical in different compartments, or different post-translationally modified forms of a single protein, share numerous invariant features such as names, molecular structure and links to external databases like UniProt or ChEBI. To enable storage of this shared information in a single place, and to create an explicit link among all the variant forms of what can also be seen as a single chemical entity, Reactome creates instances of the separate ReferenceEntity class. A ReferenceEntity instance captures the invariant features of a molecule. A PhysicalEntity instance is then the combination of a ReferenceEntity attribute (e.g., Glycogen phosphorylase UniProt:P06737) and attributes giving specific conditional information (e.g., localization to the cytosol and phosphorylation on serine residue 14).

The PhysicalEntity class has subclasses to distinguish between different kinds of entities and to ensure data integrity while enabling different handling rules for different categories:

EntityWithAccessionedSequence - proteins and nucleic acids with known sequences.

GenomeEncodedEntity - a species-specific protein or nucleic acid whose sequence is unknown, such as an enzyme that has been characterized functionally but not yet purified and sequenced, e.g., cytosolic triokinase 

SimpleEntity - other fully characterized molecules, e.g., nucleoplasmic ATP or cytosolic glutathione

Complex - a complex of two or more PhysicalEntities, e.g., FASL:FAS Receptor Trime!r:FADD complex associated with the plasma membrane

EntitySet - a set of PhysicalEntities (molecules or complexes) which function interchangeably in a given situation, e.g., Notch ligand associated with the plasma membrane. This notation allows collective properties of multiple individual entities to be described explicitly.

CatalystActivity - PhysicalEntities are paired with molecular functions taken from the Gene Ontology molecular function controlled vocabulary to describe instances of biological catalysis. An optional ActiveUnit attribute indicates the specific domain of a protein or subunit of a complex that mediates the catalysis. If a PhysicalEntity has multiple catalytic activities, a separate CatalystActivity is created for each. This strategy allows the association of specific activities with specific variant forms of a protein or complex, and also enables easy retrieval of all activities of a protein, or all proteins capable of mediating a specific molecular function.

Events - the conversion of input entities to output entities in one or more steps - are the building blocks used in Reactome to represent all biological processes. Two subclasses of Event are recognized, ReactionlikeEvent and Pathway. A ReactionlikeEvent is an event that converts inputs into outputs. A Pathway is any grouping of related Events. An event may be a member of more than one Pathway.

The ReactionlikeEvent class is further divided into Reaction, BlackBoxEvent, Polymerisation and Depolymerisation. The Reaction class holds bona fide reactions with balanced inputs and outputs. The BlackBoxEvent class is used for 'unbalanced' reactions like protein synthesis or degradation, as well as 'shortcut' reactions for more complex processes that essentially convert inputs into outputs, e.g. the series of cyclical reactions involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. The De-/Polymerisation classes can hold reactions that describe the mechanics of a de-/polymerisation reaction, which is inherently 'unbalanced' due to the nature of a Polymer (that remains the 'same' entity even after adding or subtracting a unit).

For example, Pol I, II and III dependent transcription, and mitochondrial transcription, are 4 distinct and independent processes each producing a different type of RNA molecule. However, they all result in RNA (although different types) and it can be useful to annotate the concept of 'transcription' generally.

The tools fetch the bibliographic information and create any person instances needed to annotate authorship. If the publication is not in PubMed, this information must be entered manually." )

(annotation-assertion !definition !r:ModifiedResidue "A specific modification of any residue in an EntityWithAccessionedSequence, e.g. gamma-carboxylation of glutamate residue 47 of coagulation factor X, or the conversion of lysine residue 50 of EIF5A to hypusine. A modification instance associates the modification as specified in the PSI-MOD ontology at a specific coordinate. e.g., 47, of a specific EntityWithAccessionedSequence (a ReferenceSequence). The modification itself, an instance of the psiMod class, identifies both the original amino acid residue and the chemical change it has undergone, e.g. L-gamma-carboxyglutamic acid. (Historical note: this replaces a previous annotation strategy in which the identities of the modified amino acid and its modification were specified separately.) ModifiedResidue instances should only be created if the chemical natures of the modifying group and residue can be specified in atomic detail with a psiMod term. If the position is unknown (e.g., a protein is known to be phosphorylated on three of its seven serine residues), this ambiguity can be captured by leaving the coordinate slot empty. If the modification cannot be fully specified, e.g., O-dextrin-tyrosine, where the number of glucose residues in the dextrin is indeterminate, create a GroupModifiedResidue instance instead. Notes: The modifedResidue instance has no subcellular location of its own, but inherits the location of the macromolecule with which it is associated. As shown in the example, this allows the modification details of a protein to be annotated once, and instances of the modified protein in different locations or involved in different complexes can be created without repeated annotation of the invariant modification features of the protein. When you create a new modifiedResidue instance, the form requires you to enter an EnityWithAccessionedSequence value. You must manually select the appropriate one. The curator tool does not prevent you from creating a modifiedResidue instance on hexokinase and then entering information for beta-globin into its EntityWithAccessionedSequence slot, and the confusion that results is substantial! Example: carboxyl group on L-Glutamate [MOD:00041] 47 ([21])" )

(annotation-assertion !definition !r:ReplacedResidue "The replacement of a conventional residue of a polypeptide or polynucleotide with a different conventional residue or residues. For instances of the ReplacedResidue class, the psiMod slot is multivalued (for ModifiedResidue and GroupModifiedResidue instances it is single-valued). The first psiMod slot value is the psiMod identifier for removal of the residue normally found at that position; the second (and optionally third, fourth, ...) value is that for the residue(s) replacing the removed one. The example shows the annotation of an insulin protein in which the proline normally found at position 52 has been replaced by an aspartate.([22]) The history of the modification process is not captured here: this variant insulin protein could equally well be used to annotate the post-translational modification of insulin to convert the proline residue to aspartate and the expression of a gene with a mutant codon. (Historical note: this replaces a previous annotation strategy in which replaced- and modified-residue instances were used to distinguish the degree of chemical change brought about by the modification: modifiedResidue instances were smaller changes (e.g., phosphorylation of tyrosine) and replacedResidue instances larger ones (e.g., replacement of lysine by hypusine). The PSI-MOD ontology does not make this distinction of degree, so we have changed the meaning of the replacedResidue class to enable us to capture substitutions of one amino acid for another in a protein, a form of variation that it was not previously possible to annotate in Reactome.)" )

(annotation-assertion !definition !r:GroupModifiedResidue "The modification of an amino acid residue in protein with a chemical entity that cannot be specified in atomic detail, e.g., the attachment of a dextrin or glycogen moiety to a tyrosine side chain in the protein glycogenin. Such incompletely specified chemical entities are beyond the scope of the PSI-MOD ontology but are available in the ChEBO ontology. The psiMod attribute would take a value such as MOD:00166 O4'-glucosyl-L-tyrosine, which describes the linkage between the protein and the modifying group. The modifying group is then specified with a ReferenceGroup instance (ChEBI terms) such as CHEBI:28912 'limit dextrin', as in the example: limit dextrins on L-Tyrosine [ChEBI:17895] 194 of UniProt:P46976 GYG1 ([23])." )

(annotation-assertion !definition !r:FragmentModification "The modification of a fragment of an EntityWithAccessionedSequence through deletion or insertion of consecutive amino acid residues, usually in a disease variant of a gene product." )

(annotation-assertion !definition !r:FragmentDeletionModification "The deletion of a continuous fragment of an EntityWithAccessionedSequence, e.g. deletion of amino acid residues 30 to 297 in the EGFR mutant protein EGFRvIII in glioblastoma.

(annotation-assertion !definition !r:FragmentInsertionModification "The modification of an EntityWithAccessionedSequence through insertion of a continuous fragment. The continuous fragment can originate from the same EntityWithAccessionedSequence, e.g. duplication of the kinase domain of EGFR in glioblastoma to create a tandem kinase domain TKD-EGFR, where amino acid residues 664 to 1030 are duplicated and inserted at the position 1031 within EGFR. Alternatively, the continuous fragment can originate from a different EntityWithAccessionedSequence, resulting in a fusion protein, e.g. BCR-ABL1 fusion protein in the chronic myeloid leukemia where amino acid residues 1 to 927 of BCR are fused to amino acid residues 27 to 1130 of ABL1. When creating a new FragmentInsertionModification instance, it is necessary to specify the referenceSequence, which is equal to the referenceEntity in the case of an internal duplication (UniProt P00533 EGFR for TKD-EGFR) or different from the referenceEntity in the case of a protein fusion (for BCR-ABL1, UniProt P00519 ABL1 is the referenceSequence for FragmentInsertionModification, while UniProt P11274 BCR is the referenceEntity for the EntityWithAccessionedSequence). A coordinate value of a FragmentInsertionModification instance is the position of the amino acid residue in a referenceEntity at which the inserted fragment starts (1031 for TKD-EGFR; 928 for BCR-ABL1). The startPositionInReferenceSequence and the endPositionInReferenceSequence represent the first and the last amino acid of the inserted fragment, respectively (664 and 1030 for TKD-EGFR; 27 and 1130 for BCR-ABL1)." )

(annotation-assertion !definition !r:Complex "A physicalEntity formed by the association of two or more other entities (which can themselves be complexes), which are its components. To create a valid complex instance, at least one component must be specified. Even if an entity is known to be composed of subunits, unless the subunits that allow it to be distinguished from other cellular entities can be identified, it cannot be annotated as a complex. Instead it must be an otherEntity (e.g., a generic bit of heterochromatin, or a lipid raft). However, complex instances can legitimately be created in cases in which experimental data suggest that additional subunits remain to be identified or that the stoichiometry of the complex is uncertain. Examples: A complex: Presenilin homodimer [plasma membrane] ([24]) A complex assembled from other complexes: pyruvate dehydrogenase complex [mitochondrial matrix] ([25]) A complex with several known subunits but uncertain complete composition and stoichiometry: GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase ([26])" )

These hypothetical members of the set are identified as values of the hasCandidate slot. Entities known to perform the function can be identified as values of the hasMember slot. One or more hasCandidate values are required; hasMember values are optional. Example: Raptor [cytosol]. Two splice variants of Raptor mRNA encode closely related proteins. One (member) has been shown to participate in formation of active mTORC complex; the other (candidate) is thought to do so. ([27])" )

(annotation-assertion !definition !r:DefinedSet "Two or more physicalEntities, grouped to denote interchangeable function. Thus the addition of a single nucleotide residue during RNA transcription could be annotated with the definedSet NTP [nucleoplasm] (members ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP) as input. This is useful to prevent combinatorial explosion. Any kind of physicalEntity can belong to a definedSet. Example: Cdk4/6 [nucleoplasm], with Cdk4 and Cdk6 as hasMember values. This set is used to annotate the formation of a single complex, 'Cyclin D:Cdk4/6 [nucleoplasm]', which in turn is an input entity for a single Reactome event, 'Phosphorylation of Cyclin D:Cdk4/6 complexes'. ([28]) The creation of single events that have entity sets as inputs, outputs, and the physicalEntity value of catalystActivities is preferred over the creation of eventSets in which each member event involves a different member of an isozyme family as its catalyst." )

(annotation-assertion !definition !r:OpenSet "A group of entities that can be counted in principle but not in practice, such as mRNA or long-chain fatty acid. Examples (ceruloplasmin mRNA; palmitic acid) can be attached as values of the hasMember slot, but such examples are not an exhaustive list of possible members of the set. The referenceEntity slot indicates the chemical feature that is common to all the members of this class, e.g. OpenSet 'Alcohol' would have the '-OH group' as referenceEntity. Example: 'messenger RNA', with 'ceruloplasmin mRNA' as a member. 'alcohol', with ()" )

It must be linked to a protein or polynucleotide sequence in an external database entered as the value of referenceSequence. By default, an EntityWithAccessionedSequence corresponds to the entire protein or polynucleotide described in the external database. To annotate a fragment, the numbers of its first and last residues, following the numbering scheme used in the external database, are entered as values of the startCoordinate and endCoordinate slots. A value of 0 indicates an unknown coordinate. Default start and end coordinates for a full-length sequence entity, assigned automatically if no values are provided by the curator, are 1 and -1, respectively. (-1 is a Perl usage which means the last element of an array; here, the last residue). Separate EntityWithAccessionedSequence instances are needed for each subcellular location (compartment) in which a molecule is found, e.g., kallikrein light chain [extracellular] and kallikrein light chain [plasma membrane].

The description of an instance of regulation includes the regulated entity (Event or CatalystActivity), the regulator (Event, PhysicalEntity, or CatalystActivity) and the mechanism by which regulation is achieved (Regulationtype). Regulation may be positive (if the Regulator facilitates an Event/increases a CatalystActivity), negative (if the Regulator inhibits an Event/decreases CatalystActivity) or a Requirement if the regulator is required for the CatalystActivity or for the Event to occur. Note that this class is mainly to be used when the exact nature of the regulation is not known as yet.
